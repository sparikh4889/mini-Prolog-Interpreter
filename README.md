# mini-Prolog-Interpreter
Implemented a mini-Prolog interpreter using Python3. Prolog is a logical programming language written 
using clauses and goals. Clauses can be either facts or rules. Facts are the most basic clause; it is 
a function that declares a specific relationship between two entities. The interpreter utilizes an 
abstract syntax tree to process the rules and syntax of Prolog. It can run a limited subsets of Prolog
through backtracking such as unifying and substitution.
